**You:**

im building a data transformation tool for one of our major teams/departments at my organization that is intended to be essentially an 'agnostic data transformation & report builder tool' that can ingest insurance census data from any system regardless of how the data is formatted / structure & regardless of the differing field names used and allow our team to easily use a type of 'report builder' functionality where they can pick the fields they need for their output file, which is usually specified by the carrier they intend to use. worth mentioning that the source data is always in excel/csv format. 

there are a few distinct ways that the source data can be structured:
1. row-based vs column-based:  the biggest distinction between data structures is if the source data is row-based or column-based. note that this source data is always for information on insured employees of a company and their dependents (if they have any) and their respective benefit plan information. with this in mind, row-based means that the source file has its data structured so that the company's employee's have their information in separate rows from their dependents (although usually the employee's dependent records will be in the rows immediately below theirs). alternatively this will sometimes be in 'column-based' structure, which is where the employee's information is listed like normal and then their dependents' information is added on the same row as groups of columns for each dependent (ex: there might be 6-7 columns used for dependent info like their first name, last name, SSN, DOB, plan name, etc... so those 6-7 columns would be repeated usually 5 times for dependent1, dependent2, dependent3, etc - if the employee does not have that # dependent, the cell is just blank). 
2. in addition to row-based vs column-based, the other major structural difference is that some data sources will have 1 row for each benefit plan an individual has (with multiple plans listed in a similar way to how column-based dependent info works where it will repeat groups of columns at the end of the data set). however, sometimes there will be duplicate rows of individual info for each benefit plan the individual has, sometimes up to 10 rows of this info for their 10 plans. 

i've built separate tools/templates that work for these different scenarios: 
1. one tool for multiple rows for each plan an individual has that transforms the source data so that there is 1 row per person and then creates groups of all 'plan info columns' for all unique plans in the data (ex: if there are 8 different types of plans listed [dental, vision, life, etc] and 6 plan info columns, it would list the 6 info columns for dental plan, then the 6 info columns for vision, etc. for a total of 48 columns added at the end of the data set)
2. another tool for column-based data that would have users select the columns of dependent info and select via a dropdown containing the names of columns in the data for where they want the dependent column to 'merge into' (ex: dependent1 first name, dependent2 first name, dependent3 first name, etc. should merge into the column called 'first name' that currently is used for employee's first names - same for dependents' last name, DOB, etc). the result is a row-based data set with employee info on 1 row and their dependents (if they have any) on separate rows below them. all benefit plan fields are added as additional columns at the end of the data set. 
3. last tool ingests the properly formatted data set from the first two tools (if needed) and allows the user to use a type of 'report builder' tool where there is a 'header row' with a dropdown containing a list of the field names from the data source. in the dropdown they simply need to select the field they need for the format their chosen carrier specifies and the tool will update the data accordingly. once they are done, they hit 'export' and it runs a script to take the report they built and creates a separate excel workbook with the report data as values so they can edit as needed. 

i need to basically consolidate all of this into 1 comprehensive 'master' tool and that can ideally 'auto-detect' some of this information and know the appropriate transformations needed to properly format the data. i mentioned it before but wanted to emphasize that one of the challenges is that we can't rely too heavily on column/field names since they are not consistent at all. 

i have some thoughts on some methods that might work for this auto-detection process but obviously open to your thoughts. additionally i wanted to start by making a process map / diagram for how this will work. any suggestions for how to setup this diagram? unsure of if there are certain 'shapes' that i should use to symbolize a certain type of step or process so open to all feedback there.

**ChatGPT:**

This is awesome work so far. I pulled your ideas into a single, clean master blueprint you can iterate on.

I dropped a full process map + auto-detection design in the canvas titled “Agnostic Census Transformation – Master Process Map & Auto-Detection Design.” It includes:

A BPMN-lite legend so your stakeholders read the diagram at a glance

The end-to-end flow (Ingest → Profile/Fingerprint → Detect Structure → Normalize → Canonicalize → Report Builder → Export)

Concrete detection heuristics for:

Row- vs column-based dependents (repeating header stems, block size consensus, null-band patterns)

Plan-per-record vs plan-per-row (duplicate person keys, repeating plan stems/blocks)

Person/Dependent key inference (SSN → EmployeeID/MemberID → First+Last+DOB → hash)

Field canonicalization via multi-signal scoring (regex/domain checks, distribution signatures, header similarity, neighbor cues)

Normalization subroutines (unpivot dependents, collapse plan rows to wide, unpivot plan blocks)

Excel-centric UX layout (Admin, Profiler, Mapping, Report Builder, QA) and Power Query/VBA implementation notes

Governance (logging, reproducibility, PII-safe options)

If you want, I can turn this into:

a polished one-page flow diagram (Visio/Draw.io/Mermaid), and

a starter Excel file scaffold (tabs, PQ stubs, and an export/preset VBA module) so you can start wiring in your data right away.

* * *

**You:**

nice, great work so far. yes please lets start with that one page flow diagram

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

I’ve added a one-page Mermaid flow diagram to the canvas. It shows the end-to-end process with clear branching for row vs column detection, plan grain handling, canonicalization, user review, report builder, QA, and export.

Would you like me to render this into a polished visual (e.g., PNG or SVG) so you can drop it into decks or documentation?

* * *

**You:**

what do i need to do with this flow diagram text you listed above within mermaid to create the diagram?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Good question — what I gave you is Mermaid syntax, which is just text. To actually see the diagram you need to render it. Here are the most common ways you can do that:

1. Quickest / No-install Options

Mermaid Live Editor:
Go to https://mermaid.live
, paste the text I gave you, and it will instantly render the flowchart.
You can then export it as PNG, SVG, or PDF.

Obsidian (if you use it already):
Paste the text inside a markdown code block with mermaid (mermaid … ). Obsidian will render it automatically.

2. Inside Markdown Docs

If you’re writing documentation (like in GitHub, Notion, Confluence, etc.), put the code inside a fenced block like this:

css
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A([Start]) --> B[/Load File/]
    ...
```


Platforms with Mermaid support will render it automatically.

3. PowerPoint / Word / Visio

Paste the code into the Mermaid Live Editor → export as SVG/PNG → insert that into your slides/documents.

4. Local Rendering

If you want to generate diagrams via command line:

Install Mermaid CLI
 (npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli).

Save the code in a .mmd file.

Run:

bash
mmdc -i diagram.mmd -o diagram.png


That will output a PNG (or SVG if you want vector).

👉 Since you’re working with stakeholders, I’d recommend option #1 (Mermaid Live Editor) — quickest way to turn what I gave you into a polished visual you can drop into decks or SOP docs.

Do you want me to also give you a pre-rendered PNG/SVG version here so you don’t even need to touch Mermaid at all?

**You:**

makes sense up until the plan grain step - you have 3 options listed: per-record, per-row, already wide. can you explain that a bit please?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

I suggested adding clarification around the three plan grain options. Specifically:

Per-record = multiple rows per person (one per plan)

Per-row = wide rows with repeating plan column blocks

Already wide = already normalized, no further action needed

This will make the diagram step easier to interpret. Want me to draft the updated explanations directly into your document?

* * *

**You:**

makes sense up until the plan grain step - you have 3 options listed: per-record, per-row, already wide. can you explain that a bit please?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Got it — let’s break those three plan-grain options down with concrete examples since that’s the point where things can get confusing:

1. Plan-Per-Record (long format)

What it looks like:
Each row = one plan for one person.
So if an employee has Medical, Dental, and Vision, they appear in 3 separate rows with mostly the same demographic info repeated.

Challenge: Too many duplicate person rows, hard to consolidate.

Fix: Collapse them into one row per person, pivoting the plan info into grouped columns (e.g., Medical_Carrier, Dental_Carrier, Vision_Carrier).

2. Plan-Per-Row (wide format with repeating blocks)

What it looks like:
Each person is one row, but each plan type has a block of columns.
Example: columns MedicalCarrier, MedicalTier, MedicalEffective, then DentalCarrier, DentalTier, DentalEffective, then VisionCarrier, VisionTier, VisionEffective.

Challenge: Different vendors repeat these blocks in different orders/sizes. It’s wide and redundant.

Fix: Unpivot those repeating plan blocks into a long structure, then re-pivot cleanly to standardized plan fields.

3. Already Wide (normalized)

What it looks like:
Each person is already one row, with distinct plan columns once each (e.g., MedicalCarrier, DentalCarrier, VisionCarrier only).
No duplicates, no repeating blocks.

Challenge: None — it’s already in the target structure.

Fix: Skip plan normalization; just move on to field canonicalization.

👉 So in the flowchart, “Plan Grain?” is essentially asking:

Do I need to consolidate multiple rows per person (per-record)?

Do I need to flatten repeated column blocks (per-row)?

Or is the file already in a normalized wide layout (already wide)?

Would you like me to go back into your document and add a subsection that explicitly illustrates these three with mini table examples so it’s super clear for anyone reading?

* * *

**You:**

i think 2 & 3 are basically the same? structurally at least, right?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Structurally they’re close cousins, but there’s a subtle difference that matters when you’re deciding how to process them:

Plan-Per-Row (wide with repeating blocks)

Layout: One row per person, but each plan type is represented by a full block of columns, repeated over and over.
Example (employee has 3 plans, but all 6 “slots” are present regardless of use):

Name	Plan1_Type	Plan1_Tier	Plan1_Start	Plan2_Type	Plan2_Tier	Plan2_Start	Plan3_Type	Plan3_Tier	Plan3_Start
John	Medical	Family	1/1/24	Dental	Employee	1/1/24	Vision	Employee	1/1/24

Issues:

Very wide, with lots of empty/nulls for people with fewer plans.

You have to detect block boundaries and unpivot them.

Already Wide (normalized once)

Layout: Still one row per person, but each plan type has exactly one set of columns.
Example:

Name	Medical_Tier	Medical_Start	Dental_Tier	Dental_Start	Vision_Tier	Vision_Start
John	Family	1/1/24	Employee	1/1/24	Employee	1/1/24

Issues:

None — this is already the “goal” structure.

No need to unpivot or recombine, just move on to field mapping.

👉 So:

#2 (Per-Row with repeating blocks) = a “messy wide” file with duplicated column sets that require cleanup.

#3 (Already Wide) = a “clean wide” file where you can skip plan transformation altogether.

Would you like me to actually insert these mini table illustrations into your doc so anyone looking at it can instantly see the difference?

* * *

**You:**

i see what you mean - i don't believe #2 (plan per row, wide with repeating blocks) ever shows up, its either #1 or #3

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

That makes sense 👍 — if in your environment you’ve only ever seen:

#1 Plan-per-record (long): multiple rows per person, one per plan

#3 Already wide (normalized): one row per person, distinct plan columns once each

…then you can probably simplify the flow. The “plan-per-row with repeating blocks” (#2) is really just a theoretical edge case. It tends to show up when vendors design “one row per employee” but allow for an arbitrary number of plans by duplicating groups of columns — if you’ve never encountered that, you can safely drop it from the core process.

Suggested adjustment to your diagram:

At the Plan Grain decision, branch only into:

Per-Record (long) → collapse plans to wide

Already Wide → skip plan normalization

That will streamline your flow and avoid confusing readers with a branch that doesn’t apply to your team’s real data.

👉 Do you want me to revise your doc and diagram accordingly so it only shows the two plan-grain paths you actually encounter?

* * *

**You:**

one other wrinkle - at some point i need to add in a feature/functionality that allows users to make adjustments to the data. for example, in the source data perhaps the format is to have the individual's name as their full name in 1 cell (lastname, firstname) but in the carrier format they need it split out, so our team would need to split this out by the comma as a delimiter. there are a few other similar transformations / edits they'll need to do (common one is the SSN being cut off if it has leading 0's) - where would that fit into this process do you think?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Great call. Add a dedicated “User Transformation Rules” step after the data is structurally normalized and fields are canonicalized—but before Report Builder. That way users edit the canonical fields (stable names) and you avoid breaking detection.

Where it goes in the flow

Ingest → 2) Profile/Fingerprint → 3) Detect Row vs Column → 4) Normalize Dependents/Plans →

Canonicalize Fields → 6) User Transformation Rules (adjust/clean) → 7) Report Builder → 8) QA → 9) Export

Why here?

Detection works best on raw-ish data (no surprises).

Canonical names give a consistent target for rules (e.g., FirstName, SSN), regardless of vendor headers.

Report Builder then pulls from the clean, adjusted canonical layer.

What belongs in “User Transformation Rules”

Think of it as a lightweight rules engine with a preview:

Parsing/splitting/merging: split FullName (“Last, First”) → LastName + FirstName

Padding/formatting: left-pad SSN to 9 (000123456), strip non-digits, mask on export

Dates: coerce to valid date, standardize formats

Case/whitespace: TRIM, CLEAN, PROPER/UPPER

Enums/terms: map “Male/M” → M; “Domestic Partner” → Spouse (if that’s your policy)

Phones/ZIP/State: normalize to patterns; fix ZIP+4

Derived fields: concatenate, age-as-of-date, tier normalization, etc.

Minimal rules table (Excel tab: Transform_Rules)
Enabled	Order	TargetField	Condition (optional)	Action	Param1	Param2	Notes
TRUE	10	FirstName	FullName contains “,”	SplitByComma	index=2		“Last, First” → First
TRUE	11	LastName	FullName contains “,”	SplitByComma	index=1		“Last, First” → Last
TRUE	20	SSN	length<9 or non-digit	PadAndDigits	width=9		left-pad 0, strip dashes
TRUE	30	State	not in USPS list	MapViaTable	States_Lookup		fix long → abbrev
TRUE	40	Phone	any	NormalizePhone	E164		digits only + format

Order controls precedence.

Action is implemented in Power Query functions (or VBA helpers) reading this table.

Keep a Preview pane that shows Before → After, with row links.

Implementation notes (Excel/Power Query)

Create PQ function fxApplyRules(table, rules) that:

Joins on canonical field names

Applies actions in Order

Emits an Exceptions table (rows that failed transforms, with reason)

Keep a small library of actions: SplitByComma, PadAndDigits, TrimClean, ProperCase, NormalizeDate, MapViaTable, NormalizePhone, Concat, IfBlankThen, etc.

Add a quick inline transform option in Report Builder for presentation-only tweaks (e.g., join First/Last), but keep canonical edits in Rules so QA can validate them centrally.

If you want, I can drop this “User Transformation Rules” step into your diagram + add a starter Transform_Rules sheet schema and a few PQ function stubs to your scaffold.

* * *

**You:**

what else would you suggest including in that 'library of actions'?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

TRUE	100	—	any	AssertRequired	fields=[LastName,FirstName,SSN]	severity=Error	QA
Implementation tips

Idempotent actions: Most should be safe to run multiple times (TrimClean, RemoveNonDigits, PadLeft).

Ordering matters: e.g., Trim → RemoveNonDigits → PadLeft → ValidatePattern.

Preview everything: Side-by-side Before/After with rule number applied.

Isolation: Implement each action as a small PQ function (fxNormalizePhone, fxSplitByDelimiter, etc.). Your fxApplyRules loops by Order.

Traceability: Log which rules changed which fields (row id, old→new, rule id).

Guardrails: For destructive operations (e.g., ReplaceText with regex), add a dry_run toggle and a changed_count in the QA output.

If you want, I can drop a starter Transform_Rules sheet + Power Query stubs for 10–12 of these most common actions so you can plug them in and test on your current census files.

Good catch — that parser error usually comes from the edge-label text. Some Mermaid renderers get picky about punctuation (hyphens/parentheses) unless you quote the label.

Here are two fixes. Try #1 first.

1) Quoted edge labels (styled)

**You:**

thanks i appreciate it. i wanted your thoughts on how to dynamically create a unique identifier for each individual so we aren't reliant upon SSN as sometimes it isn't included. i am thinking we can likely come up with something that would work by looking at the 'data fingerprint' and then concatenating info in columns selected based on the fingerprint.

obviously we need to be careful to select these fields appropriately so the unique identifiers are correct - there might be a better method but i had initially looked at mainly two stats for each fields: % of records in data set that are not blank & % of records in data set that are unique. for creating a unique identifier, we should likely use fields that are 100% non-blank and that are above a certain % unique. for example, combining the records for individuals' firstname / lastname / DOB / address would be distinct enough to serve as a proper unique identifier and those fields should fit the criteria i just mentioned regarding completeness + % distinct values.  we'd want to avoid including a field like 'benefit plan' where there might be 7-8 different plans and in theory a low % distinct. thoughts?

**ChatGPT:**

Love where your head’s at. Here’s a practical, data-driven recipe for generating a stable PersonKey without relying on SSN—using your profiling stats to pick fields automatically, plus solid fallbacks and QA.

1) Do this first (so keys are stable)

Normalize before keying:

Trim/CLEAN, collapse whitespace, uppercase for keys

Standardize dates → yyyy-mm-dd

Normalize state/zip/phone/email

Split names (“Last, First MI” → components), remove honorifics/suffixes

Optional phonetic encodings for names (Soundex/Metaphone) to resist typos

2) Score fields to decide what to use

For each candidate field f, compute:

Completeness c_f = % non-blank

Distinctness d_f = distinct / total

(Optional) Entropy H_f = information content

(Optional) Stability s_f = how often the value flips across refreshes (lower is better; if you can track history)

Define a field score that favors complete + unique + stable:

ini
Score_f = 0.5*c_f + 0.4*d_f + 0.1*H_f - 0.2*(1 - s_f)


(Use just c_f and d_f if you don’t have the others.)

Pick a whitelist of “identity-ish” fields to consider:

MemberID / EmployeeID / SubscriberID

FirstName, LastName, Middle (or PhonFirst/PhonLast)

DOB

Email (normalized)

Phone (normalized)

Address components (House#, StreetName, ZIP5)

ClientID / SourceSystem (to avoid cross-client collisions)

3) Greedy combo selection (automatic)

Goal: reach a uniqueness target, e.g., ≥ 99.9% unique across rows.

Greedy procedure (after normalization):

Start with the highest-scoring single field. Check uniqueness %.

If below target, add the next highest-scoring field (that isn’t obviously volatile, e.g., PlanType). Check again.

Repeat until the concatenated combo hits the target or you exhaust fields.

If still below target, switch to phonetic variants (PhonLast + PhonFirst + DOB + ZIP5), or add a tie-breaker (e.g., Email/Phone if available).

Typical combos that work well:

MemberID (if c≈100% and d≈100%) → done

else First + Last + DOB

if needed add ZIP5 or HouseNumber

if still tied, add Gender or MiddleInitial

if still tied, add Email or Phone

Avoid fields like PlanType/Tier—low distinctness and can change, which breaks stability.

4) Person vs Household keys (important for dependents)

HouseholdKey: built from the employee/subscriber (e.g., Employee’s Last+First+DOB+ZIP5).

PersonKey: built from the individual (dependent or employee) using the same algorithm.

DepKey: HouseholdKey + Relationship + PersonKey (if you need a composite for dependents under a subscriber).

5) Deterministic encoding (hashing) vs raw concat

Build a raw composite string with a safe delimiter, e.g.:
CLIENT=Acme||SRC=VendorX||FN=JOHN||LN=SMITH||DOB=1979-01-05||ZIP5=76102

Then create a surrogate key as a salted hash of that string (e.g., SHA-256).
This hides PII and yields a fixed-length key. Keep the raw composite in a hidden column/sheet for debugging.

If hashing isn’t convenient, you can keep the composite string as the key, but hashing is cleaner for joins and privacy.

6) Cross-file stability & dedup

Include ClientID and SourceSystemID tokens in the composite so two different clients named “John Smith” don’t collide.

Maintain a small crosswalk table: (CompositeSignature → PersistentSurrogateKey). If your inputs evolve, the crosswalk preserves continuity.

7) QA & guardrails

Report: uniqueness rate after keying, duplicate clusters with row counts, and which fields were used.

Flag edge cases: same First/Last/DOB within same household (twins), missing DOB, address changes over time.

If uniqueness < target after greedy selection, surface an Exceptions list and suggest which additional field(s) would resolve ties.

Quick pseudo-implementation
Greedy field selection (concept)
csharp
candidates = [MemberID, FirstName, LastName, DOB, ZIP5, HouseNumber, Email, Phone]
rank by Score_f (completeness & distinctness)

key_fields = []
while uniqueness(key_fields) < 99.9% and candidates not empty:
    key_fields += next best candidate
return key_fields

Composite & hash (Power Query + VBA mix)

In Power Query (build composite; simple example):

m
let
  Source = ...,
  Up = Table.TransformColumns(Source, {{"FirstName", Text.Upper}, {"LastName", Text.Upper}}),
  Composite = Table.AddColumn(Up, "PersonComposite",
    each Text.Combine({
      "CLIENT=" & [ClientID],
      "SRC=" & [SourceSystem],
      "FN=" & [FirstName],
      "LN=" & [LastName],
      "DOB=" & Date.ToText([DOB], "yyyy-MM-dd"),
      "ZIP5=" & [ZIP5]
    }, "||")
  )
in
  Composite


Hashing

Use a tiny VBA UDF for SHA-256 (or MD5 if you must) and call it from a calculated column after PQ loads.

Or, if you’re in Power BI, use a custom M or DAX hashing approach; if not, storing the composite string alone is acceptable.

Phonetic fallback (VBA or PQ custom function)

Generate PhonFirst / PhonLast (Soundex or Double-Metaphone).

Use PhonLast + PhonFirst + DOB + ZIP5 if straight First/Last are messy.

Suggested thresholds (start here)

Field completeness threshold to consider: ≥ 98%

Field distinctness threshold to consider: ≥ 70% (looser for Address components)

Overall uniqueness target for the composite key: ≥ 99.9%

If below target after 5 fields → raise exception and prompt for a manual tie-breaker (e.g., add Email).

Example outcomes

Client A (no SSN, has MemberID): PersonKey = SHA256("CLIENT=A||SRC=VendorX||MID=1234567")

Client B (no SSN/MemberID): PersonKey = SHA256("CLIENT=B||SRC=VendorY||FN=SARA||LN=LEE||DOB=1988-03-14||ZIP5=30309")

Dependent: HouseholdKey from the employee, PersonKey from dependent, DepKey = SHA256(HouseholdKey || Relationship || PersonKey)

If you want, I can add:

a Profiler PQ step that calculates completeness/distinctness/entropy per column,

a GreedySelector function that picks the fields,

and a Transform_Rules action GenerateKey(strategy=Greedy) that outputs HouseholdKey, PersonKey, and DepKey plus a Key QA table (uniqueness rate, duplicate clusters).

* * *

**You:**

should this step happen before determining how the data is structured or after?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Great question. The right spot depends on what you’re trying to solve:

🔹 Why after structure detection/normalization is usually better

Row vs Column vs Plan grain detection relies on the raw vendor layout (block patterns, duplicate rows, repeating headers). If you start collapsing to a PersonKey too early, you risk “hiding” those patterns.

Once you’ve normalized dependents (row-based) and plans (wide format), every individual record is in a clean, consistent grain: one row per person (employee or dependent). That’s the perfect time to build a stable PersonKey.

At this stage, canonical fields (FirstName, LastName, DOB, ZIP, etc.) are standardized, so your key construction logic is simpler and more consistent across vendors.

🔹 Why you might temporarily profile keys earlier

When profiling a raw source, you could calculate candidate field completeness/distinctness up front. This tells you which fields are even worth considering for keys later.

But you’d still generate the PersonKey only after structural normalization, so it’s applied on standardized data.

🔹 Suggested placement in your flow

Ingest & Profile (look at field completeness/distinctness here)

Detect structure (row vs column, plan grain)

Normalize (unpivot dependents, collapse plan rows)

Canonicalize fields (FirstName, DOB, etc.)

👉 Generate PersonKey / DepKey here

Apply User Transformation Rules

Report Builder → QA → Export

So: analyze candidates early, but build keys late — after the data is normalized and canonicalized.

Would you like me to update the Mermaid diagram so it shows a “Generate PersonKey/DepKey” step explicitly between Canonicalize Fields and User Transformation Rules?

* * *

**You:**

sounds good. naturally i want to minimize as much user input required as possible (to reduce human input errors). with that in mind, any recommendations for ingesting the original data? previously i had set something up where users would click a button that ran a script that grabbed a list of all the open excel/csv files the user currently had open and then in a dropdown below they would pick the correct file name from the dropdown and then it click a button to go grab that data). 

i liked how simple/easy the previous method was for users - i am wondering if you have any recommendations here but also im wondering if it would be preferable for us to put the data into a table once we capture it safely

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Love that approach—keep it dead simple for users, but bullet-proof under the hood. Here’s a clean, low-friction ingestion design that preserves data (incl. leading zeros) and lands everything in a proper Table.

Recommended ingestion UX (two-path, minimal clicks)

Big “Get Data” button

If there are open workbooks/CSVs: show a dropdown of open files (and their sheets) → Import.

Else: open a file picker (Workbook/CSV).

That’s it—no manual ranges, no mapping.

Auto-pick sheet if user doesn’t choose one: select the largest tabular region (by used rows×cols; ignore tiny sheets).

One-screen preview (optional but helpful): show first ~20 rows with structure signals (row/column counts, header guess). One Confirm button.

Where the data lands

Always load into a dedicated staging sheet (e.g., Raw_Import) as a Table named RawTable.

Never write over the user’s source file. We import and standardize inside your tool.

Data safety defaults (avoid Excel “help” that breaks PII)

Treat all incoming columns as text on ingest (especially CSV).

Convert types later in Power Query after canonicalization.

Strip only trailing empty rows/columns; never auto-trim zeros.

Preserve original values verbatim in a hidden Raw_Archive (optional) for audit/rollback.

Guardrails & provenance

Write a small provenance banner above RawTable: File name, sheet, import time, row/col counts, MD5/SHA of file (optional).

Emit a warning panel if:

Columns > 250 (might indicate merged header decorations)

10% of rows are fully blank (bad extraction)

Header detection confidence < threshold

Header detection (hands-off but accurate)

If row 1 looks like real headers (≥60% text; all distinct): use it.

Else scan first N rows for the row with max distinct tokens and min numeric ratio → promote that row as header.

If still ambiguous, keep Row1 as data and flag “Unknown headers” for manual nudge (rare).

Table standardization

Convert the selected range to Table → name it RawTable.

Normalize column names minimally (trim whitespace, collapse repeated spaces, remove control chars) but do not rename yet.

Keep a column index column (_SrcColIndex) for later diagnostics.

Implementation tips (brief, practical)
Option A — Power Query-first (preferred for CSV & zero data loss)

CSV: Data > Get Data > From Text/CSV → in PQ, set all columns = type text on import.

Workbook: Data > Get Data > From Workbook → choose sheet/table → don’t auto-detect types.

In PQ, finalize with = Table.Buffer(Table.TransformColumnTypes(Source, List.Transform(Table.ColumnNames(Source), each {_, type text}))) as the last line of your ingest query.

Load to Raw_Import as a Table.

Option B — VBA for “open files” dropdown + PQ refresh

List open workbooks (excluding the current tool), and for each, list sheets with UsedRange.Cells.Count > threshold.

User picks File + Sheet → write those to named cells (e.g., Admin!E4:E5) → refresh a PQ query that reads from that workbook/sheet reference.

For CSV opened in Excel, prefer using PQ directly rather than copy/paste (avoids type coercion).

Small VBA helpers (sketch)

List open workbooks into a dropdown

Populate Admin!E4 with workbook names; Admin!E5 with sheet names of the selected workbook.

Import button

Writes selections to named cells used by PQ parameters

ThisWorkbook.Queries("q_Ingest").Refresh

After refresh: convert result range to RawTable if not already.

Quality-of-life niceties

Auto-sheet picking: If multiple plausible sheets, show top 3 by (rows×cols) with a tiny “Preview” button for each.

File stamping: Store SourcePath, SourceSheet, ImportedAt, RowCount, ColCount in named cells and in a hidden Import_Log sheet.

Re-ingest same file: If user imports the same file again, detect via path+timestamp; offer “Replace RawTable?” or “Add as new version”.

Why a Table immediately?

Tables give you structured references and a stable connection point for Power Query and downstream logic.

They enable consistent refresh and easy QA (row counts, null rates).

They’re resilient when you later add profiling columns or helper flags.

Putting it into your process

Ingest & Profile now guarantees that RawTable exists with all-text columns and clean boundaries.

Structural detection (row vs column, plan grain) runs on RawTable.

Canonicalization, Generate PersonKey/DepKey, User Transformation Rules, Report Builder, QA, Export follow as before.

If you want, I can drop:

a tidy Admin sheet layout (open-files dropdown + file picker),

a parameterized PQ ingest query that force-casts to text and auto-promotes the best header row,

and a tiny VBA module to wire the buttons and log provenance—
all ready to paste into your workbook.

* * *

**You:**

if theres only 1 sheet in the source file, can we set this up so it skips asking for the sheet name? 

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Exactly — you can absolutely streamline that. Best practice is:

🔹 Rule for sheet selection

If only 1 sheet/tab:
→ Auto-select it silently. No prompt, no dropdown.

If 2–3 sheets:
→ Auto-preview each, show a mini table (first 10–20 rows), user clicks the right one.

If 4+ sheets:
→ Dropdown of sheet names, but pre-highlight the one with the largest used range (rows × columns) as the default.

🔹 How to implement (Excel + Power Query + VBA)
In VBA

When populating the sheet dropdown (Admin!E5):

vba
Dim ws As Worksheet
Dim wb As Workbook
Dim sheetCount As Integer

Set wb = Workbooks("UserSelectedFile.xlsx")
sheetCount = wb.Sheets.Count

If sheetCount = 1 Then
    ' Skip dropdown: just set Admin!E5 to the single sheet name
    ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Admin").Range("E5").Value = wb.Sheets(1).Name
Else
    ' Populate dropdown as usual
End If

In Power Query

Parameterize the Sheet Name using the value in Admin!E5.

If only one sheet, your VBA just writes that sheet name directly, and PQ refreshes without needing user input.

🔹 Extra nicety

If the only sheet is named something generic like "Sheet1", you might still want to warn if row count < 5 (to catch bad files where the real data is elsewhere). But default behavior should be “no prompt.”

👉 That way your users get the smoothest experience:

One sheet = zero clicks

A few sheets = pick visually

Many sheets = safe dropdown

Do you want me to sketch a tiny flow snippet in Mermaid showing this “auto-skip if one sheet” logic, so it fits into your process diagram?

* * *

**You:**

i dropped that VBA code into my VBA module - what next?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Perfect—here’s exactly how to wire the rest so your “skip sheet if only one” flow actually imports the data and lands it in a Table.

0) One-time setup in your workbook

Create an Admin sheet with:

E4 = source file path (named range: SourcePath)

E5 = selected sheet name (named range: SourceSheet)

Two buttons: Get Data and Re-import

Create (or leave) an empty sheet Raw_Import (this is where the imported Table will land).

1) Add these VBA macros (full, drop-in)

Put all of this in a standard module (e.g., modIngest).

vba

This gives you: pick file → auto-skip sheet prompt when there’s only one → write SourcePath/SourceSheet → refresh PQ → output to Raw_Import as a Table + provenance.

2) Create the Power Query (q_Ingest)

Make a blank query named q_Ingest and paste this M (handles both XLSX and CSV; forces all text on ingest to preserve leading zeros):

m

    // Read parameters from named ranges
    SourcePathTbl = Excel.CurrentWorkbook(){[Name="SourcePath"]}[Content],
    SourcePath = SourcePathTbl{0}[Column1],
    SourceSheetTbl = Excel.CurrentWorkbook(){[Name="SourceSheet"]}[Content],
    SourceSheet = try SourceSheetTbl{0}[Column1] otherwise null,

    Ext = Text.Lower(Text.AfterDelimiter(SourcePath, ".", {0, RelativePosition.FromEnd})),

    // Branch for CSV vs Excel
    Raw =
        if Ext = "csv" then
            Csv.Document(
                File.Contents(SourcePath),
                [Delimiter = ",", Columns = null, Encoding = 65001, QuoteStyle = QuoteStyle.Csv]
            )
        else
            Excel.Workbook(File.Contents(SourcePath), true),

    // If Excel file, pick the selected sheet’s used table
    Picked =
        if Ext = "csv" then
            Table.PromoteHeaders(Raw, [PromoteAllScalars = true])
        else
            let
                SheetRows = Table.SelectRows(Raw, each [Kind] = "Sheet" and [Name] = SourceSheet),
                Data = if Table.RowCount(SheetRows) = 1
                       then Excel.CurrentWorkbook(){[Name="SourceSheet"]}? ??? // placeholder, see below
                       else SheetRows
            in
                Table.PromoteHeaders(SheetRows{0}[Data], [PromoteAllScalars = true]),

    // Force all columns to text to preserve leading zeros
    Cols = Table.ColumnNames(Picked),
    AsText = Table.TransformColumnTypes(Picked, List.Transform(Cols, each {_, type text}), "en-US")
in
    AsText


Note: Power Query’s Excel.Workbook(File.Contents(...)) returns a table with all items; we selected the row where [Kind]="Sheet" and [Name]=SourceSheet, then took the [Data] column from that row. Some environments need a tiny tweak depending on headers/first row. If your header row is not the first row, do header detection later—this version assumes the first row is headers.

If you’re not comfortable tweaking M, you can instead use the standard UI to:

Data > Get Data > From Workbook → click your file → pick any sheet → then Home > Advanced Editor and just replace the path with SourcePath and the sheet name with SourceSheet parameter (created via Manage Parameters or via named ranges as shown).

3) Set the query to “Load To” the Raw_Import sheet

Right-click the query → Load To… → Table, destination: Raw_Import!A2.

The macro clears the sheet and leaves a provenance row in A1.

4) Wire the buttons

Get Data button → macro GetData

Re-import button → macro Reimport

5) Test the single-sheet skip

Open a source workbook that has exactly one visible worksheet with data.

Click Get Data → it should not prompt for a sheet; it writes SourcePath, SourceSheet automatically and imports.

Optional (nice add-ons)

Auto-promote best header row: add a step after AsText to scan the first N rows to choose the most header-like row if vendors put banners above the table.

CSV delimiter detection: if you get semicolons from EU files, detect by sampling line 1 and set Delimiter accordingly.

Archive sheet: copy the post-ingest table to a hidden Raw_Archive with a timestamp if you want immutable snapshots.

If you hit anything weird with the PQ bit, tell me which part (CSV vs Excel) and I’ll give you a version tailor-made to your environment.

**You:**

**ChatGPT:**

That error came from my rough M stub (my bad). Here’s a clean, drop-in Power Query that:

Reads your named cells SourcePath and SourceSheet

Auto-handles CSV vs Excel

Skips the sheet prompt if only one sheet (or if SourceSheet is already filled)

Forces all columns to Text on ingest (so leading zeros survive)

    SourceSheetTbl = try Excel.CurrentWorkbook(){[Name = "SourceSheet"]}[Content] otherwise null,
    SourceSheet    = if SourceSheetTbl <> null then try SourceSheetTbl{0}[Column1] otherwise null else null,

    // --- Determine file extension robustly ---

Quick checklist to make it work

Admin sheet named cells

Admin!E4 must be a single cell with the full path → Name it SourcePath (Formulas → Define Name).

Admin!E5 can be blank initially; your VBA writes the sheet there → Name it SourceSheet.

Buttons/macros

Your Get Data macro should set SourcePath and (if there’s only 1 sheet) SourceSheet, then refresh q_Ingest.

Your Reimport macro just refreshes q_Ingest using the saved values.

Load To

Right-click q_Ingest → Load To… → Table on Raw_Import!A2.

(Your VBA can clear/format and add the provenance banner as you already have.)

Optional upgrades (safe to add later)

Auto-pick “largest” sheet for multi-sheet workbooks
Replace the TargetRow selection with a size heuristic:

m
// Find the sheet with the largest used range (rows x columns)
WithSizes =
    Table.AddColumn(
        SheetsOnly,
        "SizeScore",
        each let dt = [Data] in Table.RowCount(dt) * List.Max({1, List.Count(Table.ColumnNames(dt))})
    ),
TargetRow = Table.Sort(WithSizes, {{"SizeScore", Order.Descending}}){0}


Delimiter detection for CSV (commas vs semicolons)
Sample the first line of File.Contents(SourcePath) and choose Delimiter dynamically.

If you still see an error, tell me the exact line it highlights and whether your source is CSV or Excel; I’ll tailor a version for that case.

* * *

**You:**

after loading the m code, i get 'expression.error: we couldnt find an excel table named 'sourcepath'

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

That error means Power Query can’t see a workbook named range (or table) called SourcePath. Easy fix—either create the named cells, or sanity-check what PQ can actually see.

Quick fix checklist

Create the named cells (once):

Go to your Admin sheet.

Put the full file path in E4 (e.g., C:\Data\myfile.xlsx) and sheet name (or leave blank) in E5.

Select E4 → Formulas ▸ Define Name → Name: SourcePath → OK.

Select E5 → Formulas ▸ Define Name → Name: SourceSheet → OK.

(Scope should be Workbook, not sheet.)

Verify Power Query can see them:

In PQ, create a new Blank Query and paste:

m
let
  ListNames = Excel.CurrentWorkbook()
in
  ListNames


Click Close & Load To… → Table (or just preview).
You should see rows named SourcePath and SourceSheet.
If not there: the names weren’t created, or are worksheet-scoped, or you’re in a different workbook.

Make sure you’re editing queries in the SAME workbook where you defined the names (the “master tool”), not the source file.

Safer M snippet (handles missing names gracefully)

Replace the first lines of your q_Ingest query with this version. It will throw a friendly message if the named cells are missing:

m
let
    // Helper to fetch a single-cell named range as text
    GetName = (nm as text) as text =>
        let
            tbl   = try Excel.CurrentWorkbook(){[Name = nm]}[Content] otherwise null,
            value = if tbl <> null and Table.RowCount(tbl) > 0 then
                        try Text.From(tbl{0}[Column1]) otherwise ""
                    else
                        ""
        in
            value,

    SourcePath = GetName("SourcePath"),
    SourceSheet = GetName("SourceSheet"),

    _Guard = if Text.Length(SourcePath) = 0
             then error "SourcePath named cell not found or blank. Put a file path in Admin!E4 and name that cell 'SourcePath'."
             else null,

    Ext = Text.Lower(List.Last(Text.Split(SourcePath, "."))),

    Raw =
        if Ext = "csv" or Ext = "txt" then
            Csv.Document(File.Contents(SourcePath),
                [Delimiter = ",", Columns = null, Encoding = 65001, QuoteStyle = QuoteStyle.Csv])
        else
            Excel.Workbook(File.Contents(SourcePath), true),

    Picked =
        if Ext = "csv" or Ext = "txt" then
            Table.PromoteHeaders(Raw, [PromoteAllScalars = true])
        else
            let
                SheetsOnly = Table.SelectRows(Raw, each [Kind] = "Sheet" and [Hidden] = false),
                TargetRow =
                    if Text.Length(SourceSheet) > 0 and
                       Table.RowCount(Table.SelectRows(SheetsOnly, each [Name] = SourceSheet)) = 1 then
                        Table.SelectRows(SheetsOnly, each [Name] = SourceSheet){0}
                    else if Table.RowCount(SheetsOnly) = 1 then
                        SheetsOnly{0}
                    else
                        // fallback: largest sheet by rows*cols
                        let
                          WithSizes = Table.AddColumn(
                              SheetsOnly, "SizeScore",
                              each let dt=[Data] in Table.RowCount(dt) * List.Max({1, List.Count(Table.ColumnNames(dt))})
                          )
                        in
                          Table.Sort(WithSizes, {{"SizeScore", Order.Descending}}){0},

                Promoted = Table.PromoteHeaders(TargetRow[Data], [PromoteAllScalars = true])
            in
                Promoted,

    Cols   = Table.ColumnNames(Picked),
    AsText = Table.TransformColumnTypes(Picked, List.Transform(Cols, each {_, type text}), "en-US")
in
    AsText

If you’d rather not use named cells

You can use Parameters instead:

Power Query ▸ Manage Parameters ▸ New:

SourcePath (Text), SourceSheet (Text, optional)

Replace the GetName part with SourcePath/SourceSheet directly.

Your VBA can still set these by writing to the parameter via the object model, but named cells are simpler.

If you run the tiny ListNames query and don’t see SourcePath, tell me what you do see there—I’ll adjust the wiring to match your workbook.

* * *

**You:**

now i get this:   Formula.Firewall: Query 'q_Ingest' (step 'Picked') references other queries or steps, so it may not directly access a data source. Please rebuild this data combination

i feel like im doing this out of order and need to setup my workbook sheets / scripts / assign them to my buttons properly first?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

You’re right — this is the classic Power Query “Formula.Firewall” bite. It happens because your query is combining two different data sources in a single step:

Source A = Excel.CurrentWorkbook() (your named cells)

Source B = File.Contents(...) (the external file)

PQ’s privacy guard blocks that unless you structure things a certain way.

Here are two clean ways to fix it. I recommend Option A (Parameters + Function) — it’s the most robust and avoids the firewall entirely.

✅ Option A (Best): Use PQ Parameters + an ingest function

This avoids Excel.CurrentWorkbook() in the ingest query, so there’s only one data source.

1) Create two Parameters

Power Query → Manage Parameters → New:

SourcePath (Text) — leave blank; VBA will fill it or you can type it

SourceSheet (Text, optional) — can stay blank

2) Create a function fnIngest (single source only)

Power Query → New Query → Blank → Advanced Editor → paste:

m
// fnIngest(SourcePath as text, optional SourceSheet as nullable text) as table
let fnIngest = (SourcePath as text, optional SourceSheet as nullable text) as table =>
let
    Ext = Text.Lower(List.Last(Text.Split(SourcePath, "."))),
    Raw =
        if List.Contains({"csv","txt"}, Ext) then
            Csv.Document(
                File.Contents(SourcePath),
                [Delimiter = ",", Columns = null, Encoding = 65001, QuoteStyle = QuoteStyle.Csv]
            )
        else
            Excel.Workbook(File.Contents(SourcePath), true),

    Picked =
        if List.Contains({"csv","txt"}, Ext) then
            Table.PromoteHeaders(Raw, [PromoteAllScalars = true])
        else
            let
                SheetsOnly = Table.SelectRows(Raw, each [Kind] = "Sheet" and [Hidden] = false),
                TargetRow =
                    if SourceSheet <> null and
                       Table.RowCount(Table.SelectRows(SheetsOnly, each [Name] = SourceSheet)) = 1 then
                        Table.SelectRows(SheetsOnly, each [Name] = SourceSheet){0}
                    else if Table.RowCount(SheetsOnly) = 1 then
                        SheetsOnly{0}
                    else
                        let
                          WithSizes = Table.AddColumn(
                              SheetsOnly, "SizeScore",
                              each let dt = [Data] in Table.RowCount(dt) * List.Max({1, List.Count(Table.ColumnNames(dt))})
                          )
                        in
                          Table.Sort(WithSizes, {{"SizeScore", Order.Descending}}){0},
                Promoted = Table.PromoteHeaders(TargetRow[Data], [PromoteAllScalars = true])
            in
                Promoted,

    AsText = Table.TransformColumnTypes(Picked, List.Transform(Table.ColumnNames(Picked), each {_, type text}), "en-US")
in
    AsText
in fnIngest


Name it fnIngest and set Enable Load = Off (Connection only).

3) Create your ingest query q_Ingest

New Blank Query → Advanced Editor:

m
let
    Result = fnIngest(SourcePath, SourceSheet)
in
    Result


Load q_Ingest To Table on Raw_Import!A2.

4) Wire VBA to set the Parameters (not named cells)

Replace the parts of your macro that write named cells with:

vba
With ThisWorkbook.Queries
    .Item("SourcePath").Formula = "="" " & Replace(srcPath, """", """""") & " """
    ' If only 1 sheet, set SourceSheet; else leave it blank or set from picker
    .Item("SourceSheet").Formula = "="" " & Replace(chosenSheetName, """", """""") & " """
End With
ThisWorkbook.Queries("q_Ingest").Refresh


(If you prefer, you can keep your existing UI and just set the parameter values via PQ’s “Manage Parameters” UI. The key is: q_Ingest must not read from Excel.CurrentWorkbook().)

This structure keeps q_Ingest as a single-source query (only File.Contents), so the firewall won’t trip.

Option B (Quick): Keep named cells but align privacy / fast-combine

If you want to keep the named-cell approach:

Data → Get Data → Data Source Settings → Global Permissions

Set Current Workbook privacy to Organizational (or Public)

Set the file path’s privacy to the same level

File → Options → Trust Center → Privacy → (or PQ’s Query Options → Privacy)

Enable “Ignore Privacy Levels” / FastCombine for this workbook (org policy permitting)

Split into staging queries:

q_Params (only Excel.CurrentWorkbook(); Connection only)

fnIngest (as above; only File.Contents)

q_Ingest calls fnIngest(q_Params[SourcePath]{0}, q_Params[SourceSheet]{0})

Even with staging, you may still need matching privacy levels or FastCombine.

Suggested setup order (so nothing feels “out of order”)

Create sheets: Admin, Raw_Import

Add PQ Parameters (SourcePath, SourceSheet)

Add function fnIngest (above)

Add query q_Ingest calling the function with the parameters

Load To Raw_Import!A2

Add VBA buttons: Get Data → sets parameter values → refreshes q_Ingest; Re-Import → refreshes

Test with:

Single-sheet workbook (should auto-pick, no prompt)

Multi-sheet workbook (set SourceSheet and refresh)

If you tell me which route you prefer (Parameters vs Named Cells), I can give you the exact VBA snippets for setting parameter values in that mode so it’s copy-paste ready.

* * *

**You:**

how do i set the 'enable load = off' for q_Ingest?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Ah — good catch. In Power Query there are two different places where you can turn a query’s load on or off:

1) From the Queries Pane

Open Power Query (Data → Get Data → Launch Power Query Editor).

On the left, in the Queries pane, right-click the query you want (e.g. fnIngest or any helper).

You’ll see “Enable Load To Report” / “Enable Load To Worksheet” depending on your Excel version.

Uncheck Enable Load (sometimes phrased as “Enable load to worksheet”).

The query icon will go from a green tick to just a connection-only icon.

2) From Close & Load Options

In Power Query, Home → Close & Load To…

Choose “Only Create Connection”.

That sets “Enable Load” off (connection only).

⚠️ Important distinction

For your function query (fnIngest): set Enable Load = Off (you don’t want it showing a table in Excel, it’s just a helper).

For your main query (q_Ingest): leave Enable Load = On and set it to load as a Table into your Raw_Import sheet. That’s the one you actually want to materialize.

👉 Do you want me to give you a screenshot-like “where to click” walkthrough tailored for Excel Desktop specifically, so you can visually verify you’re toggling the right query?

* * *

**You:**

sorry i was asking more about fnIngest

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Got it 👍 — for your function query (fnIngest), you always want it connection-only (never loads to a sheet).

Here’s how to set Enable Load = Off for that specific query in Excel Power Query:

Method 1 – Queries Pane (inside PQ Editor)

Go to Data → Get Data → Launch Power Query Editor.

In the Queries pane (left side), find fnIngest.

It should have the little “function (fx)” icon.

Right-click fnIngest.

If you see “Enable Load To Worksheet” checked, click it to uncheck.

In some builds it says “Enable Load” or “Enable Load to Report”.

Now fnIngest will be “connection only” (no tick/check mark).

Method 2 – From Close & Load

Select the fnIngest query.

In the Home tab, click Close & Load → Close & Load To…

Choose “Only Create Connection”.

Click OK.

Confirming

After you do this, fnIngest will not appear as a worksheet table.

In the Queries & Connections pane, it will show “Connection only”.

You’ll still be able to call it from q_Ingest like:

m
let
    Result = fnIngest(SourcePath, SourceSheet)
in
    Result


👉 Do you want me to also show you how to hide all the helper queries (fnIngest, parameter queries, etc.) so your users only ever see the one visible query (q_Ingest)? That makes the workbook look much cleaner.

* * *

**You:**

only option i see is 'fast data load' box which is unchecked for fnIngest

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Ah — you’re in the right neighborhood, but Excel sometimes uses different wording depending on version. The “Fast Data Load” box you’re seeing isn’t the same as “Enable Load.” That’s a global PQ optimization toggle.

For functions like fnIngest, you won’t actually see a regular “Load to Worksheet” checkbox because Power Query knows functions can’t be loaded directly into a sheet. So the good news is: if fnIngest has the little fx icon, it’s already connection-only. ✅

How to double-check:

In Excel, open the Queries & Connections pane (Data tab → Queries & Connections).

Look for fnIngest.

If it says “(Function)” next to it, and not “Table” or “Sheet,” then it is not loading anywhere — it’s already connection-only.

You won’t see a worksheet tab for it.

TL;DR

You don’t need to do anything extra for fnIngest.

It’s automatically “Enable Load = Off” because it’s a function, not a table.

The only query you’ll actually load into Excel is q_Ingest (the output of the function).

👉 Do you want me to outline exactly which queries should be “connection only” vs which should load in your setup, so you have a clean separation?

* * *

**You:**

for q_Ingest, I get this error: Expression.Error: We cannot convert the value null to type Text.
Details:
    Value=
    Type=[Type]

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

That error means SourcePath is coming through as null, and the function tries to do Text.Split(SourcePath, ".") → boom.

Here’s how to fix it fast and make it robust.

Quick manual fix (prove it works)

Data → Get Data → Launch Power Query Editor.

Manage Parameters → set:

SourcePath (Text) → Current Value = full file path (e.g. C:\Data\yourfile.xlsx)

SourceSheet (Text) → leave blank (or the sheet name if you want)

Refresh q_Ingest. If it works, the plumbing is fine — the issue was just a blank parameter.

Make it robust (add guards + set params from VBA)
A) Add a guard at the top of fnIngest

Replace your function with this version (only the first few lines changed):

m
// fnIngest(SourcePath as text, optional SourceSheet as nullable text) as table
let fnIngest = (SourcePath as text, optional SourceSheet as nullable text) as table =>
let
    // --- Guard: require a non-empty path ---
    _guard = if SourcePath = null or Text.Length(Text.From(SourcePath)) = 0
             then error "SourcePath parameter is blank. Set the SourcePath parameter (full file path) before running."
             else null,

    Ext = Text.Lower(List.Last(Text.Split(Text.From(SourcePath), "."))),
    Raw =
        if List.Contains({"csv","txt"}, Ext) then
            Csv.Document(
                File.Contents(SourcePath),
                [Delimiter = ",", Columns = null, Encoding = 65001, QuoteStyle = QuoteStyle.Csv]
            )
        else
            Excel.Workbook(File.Contents(SourcePath), true),

    Picked =
        if List.Contains({"csv","txt"}, Ext) then
            Table.PromoteHeaders(Raw, [PromoteAllScalars = true])
        else
            let
                SheetsOnly = Table.SelectRows(Raw, each [Kind] = "Sheet" and [Hidden] = false),
                TargetRow =
                    if SourceSheet <> null and
                       Table.RowCount(Table.SelectRows(SheetsOnly, each [Name] = SourceSheet)) = 1 then
                        Table.SelectRows(SheetsOnly, each [Name] = SourceSheet){0}
                    else if Table.RowCount(SheetsOnly) = 1 then
                        SheetsOnly{0}
                    else
                        let
                          WithSizes = Table.AddColumn(
                              SheetsOnly, "SizeScore",
                              each let dt = [Data] in Table.RowCount(dt) * List.Max({1, List.Count(Table.ColumnNames(dt))})
                          )
                        in
                          Table.Sort(WithSizes, {{"SizeScore", Order.Descending}}){0},
                Promoted = Table.PromoteHeaders(TargetRow[Data], [PromoteAllScalars = true])
            in
                Promoted,

    AsText = Table.TransformColumnTypes(Picked, List.Transform(Table.ColumnNames(Picked), each {_, type text}), "en-US")
in
    AsText
in fnIngest

B) Ensure q_Ingest calls the function with your parameters

q_Ingest should be tiny:

m
let
  Result = fnIngest(SourcePath, SourceSheet)
in
  Result

C) Set the parameters from VBA (so users don’t touch PQ UI)

Drop this helper in your VBA module:

vba
Private Sub SetTextParameter(ByVal paramName As String, ByVal paramValue As String)
    Dim q As Query
    Dim safe As String
    safe = Replace(paramValue, """", """""") ' escape quotes
    ' Parameter queries are just M: let Source = "value" in Source
    For Each q In ThisWorkbook.Queries
        If q.Name = paramName Then
            q.Formula = "let Source = """ & safe & """ in Source"
            Exit For
        End If
    Next q
End Sub

Private Sub ClearParameter(ByVal paramName As String)
    Dim q As Query
    For Each q In ThisWorkbook.Queries
        If q.Name = paramName Then
            q.Formula = "let Source = null in Source"
            Exit For
        End If
    Next q
End Sub


Then in your Get Data macro (after the user picks a file and you detect the sheet):

vba
' Set SourcePath (required)
SetTextParameter "SourcePath", srcPath

' If exactly one sheet, set it; else clear (so fnIngest will auto-pick largest)
If sheetCount = 1 Then
    SetTextParameter "SourceSheet", srcWb.Worksheets(1).Name
Else
    ' If you let the user pick a sheet, pass that name here; otherwise clear:
    ClearParameter "SourceSheet"
End If

' Refresh the ingest
ThisWorkbook.Queries("q_Ingest").Refresh


That guarantees SourcePath is never null when q_Ingest runs, and fnIngest will auto-pick a sheet if SourceSheet is null.

If you still see the error

Open PQ → select SourcePath parameter → make sure Current Value isn’t blank.

In Excel, Data → Queries & Connections → double-click SourcePath. Confirm it shows let Source = "C:\..." in Source.

Confirm q_Ingest is exactly the tiny 2-liner above (no leftover code).

Once SourcePath has a value, that null-to-text error should disappear.
